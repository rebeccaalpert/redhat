# Open Ended Questions

## Section 1 - Design & Development

### Q1
**Could you outline what you would consider to be the most important considerations if you were asked to develop a web application that could potentially be used by thousands of users?**  
I've never developed a web application potentially used by thousands of users, so I don't have practical experience. That said, I really care about user experience and security. I would want to make sure that the application was well-tested, well-designed, and secure.  

I've had some bad user experiences on large, big-name websites. They were experiences like favoriting an item and being shown a bunch of JSON on the next page. That sort of stuff is easily fixed--people just weren't QAing their sites enough. It's important to make sure that everything is well-QAed.  

If thousands of users hit a server and it goes down, that's also a terrible user experience. The application would need to be able to gracefully accomodate that many people.  

In addition, a highly used web application would be a higher-profile target when it comes to security. I would want to make sure that the application was hardened against common vulnerabilities (many web applications are still vulnerable to very basic stuff on the OWASP Top Ten List--it's inexcusable).

### Q2
**What techniques do you employ to keep up-to-date with the rapid pace of progress in the field of front-end development? How do you choose which technologies are worth taking the time to learn more about?**  
I subscribe to some e-newsletters that share useful articles and I read websites--I really like CSS-Tricks and Smashing Magazine. When I was developing emails on a regular basis, I loved Really Good Emails.  

I learn new technologies when they'll positively impact the projects I'm working on. While I really like learning new things, I don't want to blindly jump on the "hot-new-thing" bandwagon - I want it to be a step up from what I've been using. For example, I've been dipping my toes into FlexBox lately because it makes it so easy to center elements with dynamic sizes.

## Section 2 - Deployment

### Q1
**Describe the approach you take to testing your applications.**  
I write front-end code on a regular basis in my internship at Evergage. I use Javascript/JQuery to map website catalogs and I use HTML, CSS, and JQuery to create new website components. I test everything I make, and I also QA other people's website components.

When it comes to catalog mapping, I check Chrome Developer Tools to make sure that the Evergage platform is receiving the right information. I also QA a wide selection of imported catalog items in the Evergage platform to make sure that the data is formatted appropriately.

When it comes to creating new components, I make sure that they look good in different browsers/on different devices. I test overall page functionality to make sure that the new component didn't break anything. I also check Chrome Developer Tools to make sure that the Evergage platform is receiving and sending the right information.

### Q2
**What do you value in a code base?**  
Organization, consistency, and documentation are very important to me. It makes it much easier to read and understand other people's code if it's well-organized, well-commented, and styled in a consistent way.

## Section 3 - General

### Q1
**What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development field?**  
I love making things. I was never very good at shop class, but I can write HTML and CSS. I love the satisfaction of taking a PDF and turning it into a beautiful, functional page, component, or email.  

I also love that I'm always learning, and that there's a community to turn to if I get stuck.

### Q2
**In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?**  
At Tufts University, I created a landing page for a new program called Tufts Summer MiniSession. I had a lot of freedom--I was given a print brochure to base it on, and that's it.  

It was my first time managing a high-profile front-end project from concept to execution, and it gave me a chance to apply a lot of the concepts I learned in my Human Factors and Computer Science coursework. I created wireframes and reviewed them with stakeholders, created higher-fidelity wireframes incorporating their feedback, and then moved onto development (my favorite part). I'm very proud to say that the clients loved it.  

At the time, my department didn't have a very modern web presence, and this was a fully-responsive landing page. I was very proud to help advance the quality of our web presence and have an impact on recruitment for the event.
